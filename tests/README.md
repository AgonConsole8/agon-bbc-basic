# tests

A handful of BBC BASIC programs I use for regression and soak testing:

- `cube.bbc` Tests the graphics and floating point maths
- `sound.bbc` Tests the SOUND command, should play Amazing Grace
- `udg.bbc` Test VDU 23

And there are also a set of Rugg/Feldman (PCW) benchmark programs; benchm1.bbc to benchm8.bbc
