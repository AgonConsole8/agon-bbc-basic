## Copying to the SD card

Copy the bbcbasic.bin file to the root folder of the SD card and launch using:
```
LOAD bbcbasic
RUN
```
If you want to launch a BBC BASIC program immediately after running, you can specify a path
```
LOAD bbcbasic
RUN &40000 tests/cube.bbc
```
Note that you have to pass the load address (default is &40000) to the run as subsequent parameters will be passed to the executable.

## BBC BASIC for Z80 (Agon)

In addition to the core BBC Basic for Z80 core language (details of which [can be found here](bbcbasic.txt)), BBC Basic for Agon adds the following functionality:

## Editor

BBC BASIC currently uses the MOS editor

- Use the cursor keys to navigate around the current edit line
- Line lengths must be less than 256 characters

## Star Commands

The following * commands are supported

### *BYE

Exit BASIC and return to MOS.

### â€¢EDIT linenum

Pull a line into the editor for editing.

### *FX osbyte, params

Execute an OSBYTE command.

### *VERSION

Display the current version of BBC BASIC

In addition, any of the MOS commands can be called by prefixing them with a *

* `*CAT`: Directory listing of the current directory. Aliases include `DIR` and `.`
* `*CD path`: Change current directory
* `*LOAD filename <addr>`: Load a file from the SD card to the specified address
* `*MKDIR filename`: Make a folder on the SD card
* `*SAVE filename addr size`: Save a block of memory to the SD card
* `*RUN <addr>`: Call an address in memory (switching to Z80 mode - ADL=0)
* `*DEL filename`: Delete a file or folder (must be empty). Aliases include `ERASE`
* `*REN filename1 filename2`: Rename a file
* `*JMP addr`: Jump to the specified address in memory
* `*SET option value`: Set a system option

See the [MOS documentation](https://github.com/breakintoprogram/agon-mos/blob/main/README.md) for more details

## BASIC

The following statements differ from the BBC Basic standard:

### LOAD
### SAVE

The following file extensions are supported:

- `.BBC`: BBC BASIC for Z80 tokenised format
- `.TXT`: Plain text
- `.ASC`: Plain text

If a file extension is omitted, ".BBC" is assumed

### MODE n

Three modes currently supported by the VDP.
These can be tweaked by modifying the function set_mode in the VDP code.

- `MODE 0`: 1024 x 768 @ 60Hz,  2 colours per pixel (paletted) 
- `MODE 1`:  512 x 384 @ 60hz, 16 colours per pixel (paletted)
- `MODE 2`:  320 x 200 @ 75Hz, 64 colours per pixel

Note that these resolutions require VPD 1.03 or higher.

### COLOUR c
### COLOUR c,r,g,b

If one parameter is passed:

- If c is between 0 and 63, the foreground text colour will be set
- If c is between 128 and 191, the background text colour will be set

If three parameters are passed, and the mode is a paletted mode, then the colour c will be set to the passed rgb value

Note that this requires VPD 1.03 or higher.

### GCOL mode,c

Set the graphics colour to c; mode is currently ignored.

Note that this requires VPD 1.03 or higher.

### POINT(x,y)

This returns the rgb value of the pixel as a 24-bit integer

### PLOT mode,x,y

Plot supports the following operations:

- 4: Move
- 5: Line
- 80: Filled Triangle
- 144: Circle with radius specified either by x or y
- 148: Circle passing through point x,y

### GET$(x,y)

Returns the ASCII character at position x,y

### SOUND channel,volume,pitch,duration 

- `Channel`: 0 to 2
- `Volume`: 0 (off) to -15 (full volume)
- `Pitch`: 0 to 255
- `Duration`: -1 to 254 (duration in 20ths of a second, -1 = play forever)

### VDU

The VDU command is a work-in-progress with a handful of mappings implemented:

- `VDU 8`: Cursor left
- `VDU 9`: Cursor right
- `VDU 10`: Cursor down
- `VDU 11`: Cursor up
- `VDU 12`: CLS
- `VDU 13`: Carriage return
- `VDU 16`: CLG
- `VDU 17 colour`: COLOUR colour
- `VDU 18, mode, colour`: GCOL mode, colour
- `VDU 19, l, p, r, g, b`: COLOUR l, r, g, b
- `VDU 22, n`: Mode n
- `VDU 23, n`: UDG / System Commands
- `VDU 25, mode, x; y;`: PLOT mode, x, y
- `VDU 29, x; y;`: Graphics origin
- `VDU 30`: Home cursor
- `VDU 31, x, y`: TAB(x, y)
- `VDU 127`: Backspace

Examples:

`VDU 25,64,128;88;` Plot point in middle of screen
`VDU 22,1` Change to Mode 1
