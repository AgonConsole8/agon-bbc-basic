In addition to the core BBC Basic for Z80 core language (details of which [can be found here](bbcbasic.txt)), BBC Basic for Agon adds the following functionality:

## Editor

BBC BASIC currently uses the MOS editor

- Use the cursor keys to navigate around the current edit line
- Line lengths must be less than 256 characters

## Star Commands

The following * commands are supported

### *BYE

Exit BASIC and return to MOS.

### â€¢EDIT linenum

Pull a line into the editor for editing.

### *FX osbyte, params

Execute an OSBYTE command.

In addition, any of the MOS commands can be called by prefixing them with a *

* `*CAT`: Directory listing of the current directory. Aliases include `DIR` and `.`
* `*CD path`: Change current directory
* `*LOAD filename <addr>`: Load a file from the SD card to the specified address
* `*MKDIR filename`: Make a folder on the SD card
* `*SAVE filename addr size`: Save a block of memory to the SD card
* `*RUN <addr>`: Call an address in memory (switching to Z80 mode - ADL=0)
* `*DEL filename`: Delete a file or folder (must be empty). Aliases include `ERASE`
* `*REN filename1 filename2`: Rename a file
* `*JMP addr`: Jump to the specified address in memory
* `*SET option value`: Set a system option

See the MOS documentation for more details

## BASIC

The following statements differ from the BBC Basic standard:

### MODE n

Three modes currently supported by the VDP.
These can be tweaked by modifying the function set_mode in the VDP code.

- `MODE 0`: 640 x 480 @ 60Hz (VGA)
- `MODE 1`: 512 x 384 @ 60hz (VGA)
- `MODE 2`: 320 x 200 @ 75Hz (VGA)

### GCOL mode, r,g,b

Set the graphics colour to the specified rgb colour. Each component is a number between 0 and 255

### VDU

The VDU command is a work-in-progress with a handful of mappings implemented:

- `VDU 8`: Backspace
- `VDU 9`: Advance one character
- `VDU 10`: Line feed
- `VDU 11`: Move cursor up one line
- `VDU 12`: CLS
- `VDU 13`: Carriage return
- `VDU 16`: CLG
- `VDU 18, mode, r, g, b`: GCOL mode, r, g, b
- `VDU 23, n`: VDP commands - see the VDP documentation for more details
- `VDU 22,n`: Mode n
- `VDU 25,mode, x; y;`: PLOT mode,x,y
- `VDU 29, x; y;`: Set graphics origin to x,y
- `VDU 30`: Home cursor
- `VDU 31, x, y`: TAB(x,y)
- `VDU 127`: Backspace

Examples:

`VDU 25,64,128;88;` Plot point in middle of screen

`VDU 22,1` Change to Mode 1
